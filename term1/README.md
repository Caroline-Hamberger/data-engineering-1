### OPERATIONAL LAYER

**Goals:**
- Create an operational data layer in MySQL. 
- Import a relational data set of your choosing into your local instance. 
- Find a data which makes sense to be transformed in analytical data layer for further analytics.

The data I imported was originally sourced here: https://github.com/bbrumm/databasestar/tree/main/sample_databases/sample_db_superheroes/mysql

A note, in case you are a fan of comic books: While the schema is named "superheroes", the data itself includes a number of villains, and anti-heroes and would therefore be better suited referred to as "comic book characters". Since this happens to be a terribly inconvenient naming convention, I am sticking with the "superheroes" label.

The script for importing the data is [hamberger_data.sql](https://github.com/Caroline-Hamberger/data-engineering-1/blob/main/term1/hamberger_data.sql)
